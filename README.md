### ü§ñ Universal Robot Movement Control Chip
**Lead Developer** of a custom **AI-driven chip** aimed at enabling robots (both quadruped and humanoid) to autonomously adapt and optimize their movement across various terrains. This project leverages **MuJoCo** for generating random robot bodies and simulating 4,000 parallel environments with **JAX**, efficiently training models to generalize across diverse configurations. Currently, I‚Äôm focused on integrating trained models into real-world robots and designing a universal chip for wider robotic deployment.

### üèÉ Evolving Virtual Creatures for Soccer
As a **Machine Learning Researcher** at UTMIST, I developed **virtual creatures** optimized for locomotion and task coordination in a 2v2 soccer environment. Using **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** for locomotion and **Transformer Neural Networks** for strategy, the project combines **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** and **AlphaZero** framework principles, enabling multi-agent collaboration in simulated environments. This project was presented at multiple conferences, highlighting advancements in AI-driven teamwork and behavior.

### ü¶ø Hybrid NEAT + DDPG for AI Locomotion
Designed a **hybrid reinforcement learning system** that combines **NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)** and **DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient)**. The project starts by training a network to mimic human motion-captured data for a virtual bipedal robot and then uses DDPG to fine-tune these networks, improving control on rough terrain. This adaptable framework demonstrates strong potential for real-world applications in both bipedal and quadruped robots.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Open-Source Tooling
My open-source contributions span a variety of useful libraries and tools:

- **SignWave**: A **sign language transcription tool** that won first place at JamHacks. It uses MediaPipe to convert hand gestures into structured JSON for generating accurate animations.
- **IMEI Lookup Library**: A highly efficient Python tool for IMEI lookups, which reduces lookup costs by up to 98% through Google search and API integrations.
- **ASN.1 to Array Converter** and **Address Cleanup Utility**: Libraries for converting data formats and geographic normalization, enabling more efficient data management.
