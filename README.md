## üöÄ Projects & Repositories

### üåç Reinforcement Learning Algorithms
A repository showcasing a collection of **reinforcement learning implementations** built from scratch, focusing on both traditional and custom algorithms in **neural networks** with `NumPy`. This repository is a resource for anyone exploring the fundamentals and intricacies of reinforcement learning.

### ü§ñ Universal Robot Movement Control Chip
**Lead Developer** of a custom **AI-driven control chip** aimed at enabling robots (both quadruped and humanoid) to autonomously adapt and optimize their movement across various terrains. This project leverages **MuJoCo** for generating random robot bodies and simulating 4,000 parallel environments with **JAX**, efficiently training models to generalize across diverse configurations. Currently, I‚Äôm focused on integrating trained models into real-world robots and designing a universal chip for wider robotic deployment.

### üèÉ Evolving Virtual Creatures for Soccer
As a **Machine Learning Researcher** at UTMIST, I developed **virtual creatures** optimized for locomotion and task coordination in a 2v2 soccer environment. Using **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** for locomotion and **Transformer Neural Networks** for strategy, the project combines **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** and **AlphaZero** framework principles, enabling multi-agent collaboration in simulated environments. This project was presented at multiple conferences, highlighting advancements in AI-driven teamwork and behavior.

### ü¶ø Hybrid NEAT + DDPG for AI Locomotion
Designed a **hybrid reinforcement learning system** that combines **NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)** and **DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient)**. The project starts by training a network to mimic human motion-captured data for a virtual bipedal robot and then uses DDPG to fine-tune these networks, improving control on rough terrain. This adaptable framework demonstrates strong potential for real-world applications in both bipedal and quadruped robots.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Open-Source Tooling

### MeridianIQ
A tool for address processing and cleanup, **MeridianIQ** processes addresses and retrieves latitude and longitude based on city, state/province, and country information for Canadian and U.S. locations. It uses a **language model (OllamaLLM)** to parse address components and Google Search as a backup, ensuring high accuracy and reliability.

- **Features**:
  - Processes addresses and extracts city, state/province, and country.
  - Retrieves coordinates using postal code datasets.
  - Utilizes OllamaLLM for parsing address strings and Google Search for fallbacks.
  - Logs failed lookups for further investigation.

### IMEI Lookup Library
The **IMEI Lookup Library** is a Python package for looking up phone models using IMEI numbers. Combining Google search and API calls, it retrieves phone model information efficiently while caching results to avoid redundant lookups.

- **Features**:
  - Lookup via Google and APIs.
  - Caches results and logs failed lookups.
  - Generates visualizations (bar graphs, pie charts) for phone model distributions.
  - Supports large CSV processing with progress tracking.

### Flexiparse
The **Flexiparse** library dynamically parses and exports data from OpenSearch JSON API responses into structured CSV format, automating the extraction and transformation of unstructured JSON data into a usable format.

- **Features**:
  - Dynamically extracts fields from OpenSearch JSON responses.
  - Customizable column ordering for DataFrame output.
  - Exports parsed data to CSV for further analysis.

### Havoc Monkey
A **network resilience testing tool**, Havoc Monkey simulates disruptions inspired by Netflix‚Äôs Chaos Monkey, testing network reliability through randomized interface toggling, traffic shaping, and latency injection in virtualized environments like vSRX routers.

- **Features**:
  - Configurable for interface toggling, traffic shaping, and latency injection.
  - Logs actions and restores original network states upon termination.
  - Includes a Toronto IX Traffic Simulation for realistic traffic modeling.
